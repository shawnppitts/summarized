# Summarized https://summarized.herokuapp.com/
##### Summarized is a web application that allows users to enter a url link to an article and summarize the content within 1-10 bulletpoints.

Summarized's logic is built off a python library called 'Sumy'. Sumy uses extractive text summarization to pick portions of text and construct a summary. 
The other technique used in text summarization is abstractive which optimizes the chance of the summary given the contents first two sentences.
The reason I used an extractive text summarization library is due to the evaluation methods contained in sumy.
